# Raybitt Discord Bot
Raybitt is a versatile Discord bot designed to assist users with various tasks, enrich the server experience, and facilitate community interaction.

## Features
Raybitt provides an array of commands spanning different functionalities:

**Information & Assistance**: `/helpme` provides a comprehensive list of available commands.
**Text & Data Conversion**: `/text2binary` (t2b) and binary2text (b2t) enable conversion between textual and binary data.
**Unit Conversion**: `/convert` supports conversions among various units such as ounces to grams, inches to centimeters, and others.
**Server Analytics**: `/stats` displays various server statistics including total, online, and offline members, as well as the number of text and voice channels.
**Activity Monitoring**: `/topactive` shows the most active members, `/topchannels` lists the text channels with the most messages, and `/topvoice` exhibits the voice channels with the most members.
**Word Analytics**: `/top5` and `/wc` help monitor word usage in the server.
**Fun & Miscellaneous**: Raybitt also offers commands for jokes, mathematical operations, and random number generation.

## Usage
To get started, type `/helpme` to see a list of all available commands. For instance, to convert text into binary, use `/t2b <your_text_here>`, replacing `<your_text_here>` with the text you want to convert.

## How It Works
Raybitt uses the nextcord library, a fork of discord.py, to interact with the Discord API. Each feature of the bot is encapsulated in a "cog", a Python class that extends `commands.Cog` and contains one or more commands or event listeners.

The bot is designed to be easily extensible. To add a new feature, one can create a new cog with the desired commands and add it to the bot.
